    """Build Isolation Kernel feature vector representations via the feature map
    for a given dataset.

    Isolation kernel is a data dependent kernel measure that is
    adaptive to local data distribution and has more flexibility in capturing
    the characteristics of the local data distribution. It has been shown promising
    performance on density and distance-based classification and clustering problems.

    This version uses iforest to split the data space and calculate Isolation
    kernel Similarity. Based on this implementation, the feature
    in the Isolation kernel space is the index of the cell in Voronoi diagrams. Each
    point is represented as a binary vector such that only the cell the point falling
    into is 1.

    Parameters
    ----------

    n_estimators : int
        The number of base estimators in the ensemble.


    max_samples : int
        The number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
            - If float, then draw `max_samples` * X.shape[0]` samples.
            - If "auto", then `max_samples=min(8, n_samples)`.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the pseudo-randomness of the selection of the feature
        and split values for each branching step and each tree in the forest.

        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
